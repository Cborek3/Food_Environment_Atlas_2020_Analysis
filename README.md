# Food_Environment_Atlas_2020_Analysis
The intention of this analysis is to develop an understanding of the relationship between variables in the data set and the target variable DIRFARMSALES12

# Literature
To better understand what improves Direct Farmer Sales in a given county, research was done on literature regarding consumer habits of purchasing nutritional, or local foods. Literature suggested that the most important variables that are in this data set are the population of food-stores, restaurants, and health habits of consumers in a county.

# Analysis
The analysis  compared literature findings to what actually occurred. The findings indicate that while the variables chosen in the literature had a relationship with direct farmer sales, they were very weak compared to other variables. Counties that have a culture of growing their own food today are the strongest in direct farmer sales, as these counties are used to purchasing foods directly from the farm.

Counties that are more urban, still care for nutritional foods. However, they do not purchase these foods through the same means of counties that product more. Urban counties instead are used to purchasing their foods from grocery stores, or restaurants.

From this study, farmers have two approaches to marketing in a given area given the culture of that area. To urban areas, it is more likely a farmer will want to distribute as wholesale, or to restaurants. Whereas in less urban areas a farmer may have better sales selling directly to consumer.
